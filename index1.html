<h1>About me</h1>

<p>Hi my name is Brodie Colvin, I live in Wagga Wagga NSW Australia my student id is s3515209. My personal interests are Online gaming, online interactions using streaming utilities as well as optimising dated hardware and semi obsolete platforms to increase usability longevity. My primary reason to study came from my current employment which in the next 2 years or so will become 90% automated, chances are I wont be working there by the time I complete my studies, Im glad to have made the decision to study. So my main goal is to secure employment to provide for my family, secondary to challenging myself in areas of my interests.</p>

<h2>information technology for social interaction </h2>
<p>Social interaction and participation are important for setting up a network of people with similar interests to explore possibilities and advancing skills and knowledge. For example I am currently setting up a channel for streaming and it only through the help of online friends and other streamers that I can now if I want broadcast my stream. 

I live and work in rural central NSW although demand for Information Technology skills are quiet low its a great place to raise kids.  </p>
