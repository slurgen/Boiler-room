<h1>About me</h1>

<p>Hi my name is Brodie Colvin, I live in Wagga Wagga NSW Australia my student id is s3515209. My personal interests are Online gaming, online interactions using streaming utilities as well as optimising dated hardware and semi obsolete platforms to increase usability longevity. My primary reason to study came from my current employment which in the next 2 years or so will become 90% automated, chances are I wont be working there by the time I complete my studies, Im glad to have made the decision to study. So my main goal is to secure employment to provide for my family, secondary to challenging myself in areas of my interests.</p>

<h2>Information Technology for social interaction </h2>
<p>Social interaction and participation are important for setting up a network of people with similar interests to explore possibilities and advancing skills and knowledge. For example I am currently setting up a channel for streaming and it only through the help of online friends and other streamers that I can now if I want broadcast my stream. 

I live and work in rural central NSW although demand for Information Technology skills are quiet low its a great place to raise kids.  </p>

<h2>How i got interested in Information Technology</h2> 
<p>My interest in Information technology initially started with our first computer. When every 1 else were getting a commodore 64 we got an Atari 512 no hard disk just floppies. After outgrowing our first pc we got a used 386, from an add in the paper. Lucky the guy that sold it to use was very helpful and alerted us to the fact that computers we up gradable. From then on my brother and I would frequent auctions where old office computers were often sold on pallets of parts for cheap. We would buy bulk lots take them home and see what would fit, there were no instructions and no google. As we went on the opportunity to set up a network became available our first network was a ring daisy chain. Naturally our main motivator was to play games with each other quake, transport tycoon and I think scorched earth was in there too. Without going too far the rest was history my brother completed his degree straight out of year 12 where as I became obsessed with the opportunity to play games with others on a network. </p>

<h2>My experience in Information Technology</h2>
<p>My experience in IT is mainly online collaboration (multiplayer gaming) I have built many PCs from standard boxes to high end performance gaming machines. As a group of enthusiasts we navigated our way through various network protocols to achieve Local area networks suitable for our needs. I have being in a leading role managing teams for multiplayer game competitions (before esports) all the while troubleshooting mine and others hardware and software issues. </p>

<h2>My ideal job overview</h2>
<p>The job advertisement linked above appeals to me in a few different ways. Obviously it is an Information Technology oriented job dealing with many different aspect of technology from network protocol to implementing new systems and finally support for existing systems. Another reason this job advertisement appeals to me is location based I live in the Riverina “food bowl capital of NSW” agriculture is a big part of the area where I live to help local growers improve their existing practices would be immensely rewarding.</p><br>
<p>This job entails the mandatory Infotech skills, systems and network. But I think to be successful in this position interpersonal skills are a must to explain solutions to customers that may not have the same depth of knowledge as you or others in your team. Secondary most important is the need for experience in current agriculture environment and industry practices, which will help with the latter in many respects. I consider myself to have and intermediate knowledge of networking. I am from an agriculture background so being able to identify with the general customer base I would see as an advantage.
I plan to get the necessary skills from working hard at my studies but just as important will be increasing personality skill needed to be a great customer support. </p><br>
