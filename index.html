<h1>About me</h1>

<p>Hi my name is Brodie Colvin, I live in Wagga Wagga NSW Australia my student id is s3515209. My personal interests are Online gaming, online interactions using streaming utilities as well as optimising dated hardware and semi obsolete platforms to increase usability longevity. My primary reason to study came from my current employment which in the next 2 years or so will become 90% automated, chances are I wont be working there by the time I complete my studies, Im glad to have made the decision to study. So my main goal is to secure employment to provide for my family, secondary to challenging myself in areas of my interests.</p>

<h2>Information Technology for social interaction </h2>
<p>Social interaction and participation are important for setting up a network of people with similar interests to explore possibilities and advancing skills and knowledge. For example I am currently setting up a channel for streaming and it only through the help of online friends and other streamers that I can now if I want broadcast my stream. 

I live and work in rural central NSW although demand for Information Technology skills are quiet low its a great place to raise kids.  </p>

<h2>How i got interested in Information Technology</h2> 
<p>My interest in Information technology initially started with our first computer. When every 1 else were getting a commodore 64 we got an Atari 512 no hard disk just floppies. After outgrowing our first pc we got a used 386, from an add in the paper. Lucky the guy that sold it to use was very helpful and alerted us to the fact that computers we up gradable. From then on my brother and I would frequent auctions where old office computers were often sold on pallets of parts for cheap. We would buy bulk lots take them home and see what would fit, there were no instructions and no google. As we went on the opportunity to set up a network became available our first network was a ring daisy chain. Naturally our main motivator was to play games with each other quake, transport tycoon and I think scorched earth was in there too. Without going too far the rest was history my brother completed his degree straight out of year 12 where as I became obsessed with the opportunity to play games with others on a network. </p>

<h2>My experience in Information Technology</h2>
<p>My experience in IT is mainly online collaboration (multiplayer gaming) I have built many PCs from standard boxes to high end performance gaming machines. As a group of enthusiasts we navigated our way through various network protocols to achieve Local area networks suitable for our needs. I have being in a leading role managing teams for multiplayer game competitions (before esports) all the while troubleshooting mine and others hardware and software issues. </p>

<h2>My ideal job overview</h2>
<p>The job advertisement linked above appeals to me in a few different ways. Obviously it is an Information Technology oriented job dealing with many different aspect of technology from network protocol to implementing new systems and finally support for existing systems. Another reason this job advertisement appeals to me is location based I live in the Riverina “food bowl capital of NSW” agriculture is a big part of the area where I live to help local growers improve their existing practices would be immensely rewarding.</p><br>
<p>This job entails the mandatory Infotech skills, systems and network. But I think to be successful in this position interpersonal skills are a must to explain solutions to customers that may not have the same depth of knowledge as you or others in your team. Secondary most important is the need for experience in current agriculture environment and industry practices, which will help with the latter in many respects. I consider myself to have and intermediate knowledge of networking. I am from an agriculture background so being able to identify with the general customer base I would see as an advantage.
I plan to get the necessary skills from working hard at my studies but just as important will be increasing personality skill needed to be a great customer support. </p><br>

<h1>My project idea</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Australia with its vast and not so open environment the collection of data across large distances could be troublesome and time consuming. Where I am from the Riverina with its high soil fertility and abundance of water in the floodplain has made the Riverina region one of the most productive farming regions in Australia.  As we all move to a more sustainable way of farming the need for monitoring and data collection I feel is more important. My project idea consists of the automation of data collection and to make data collected relevant.</p>

<h2>motivation</h2>
<p>My main motivation for my project comes from the idea of sustainable agriculture and the future trends of food consumption. It is estimated the total value of the Australian certified organic industry to be AU$1.72 billion Being able to accurately water plant will increase production as well as increasing plant health thus reducing the need for fertilisers and pesticides reducing water wastage will minimise unwanted plants and reducing the need for herbicides and with the rise of the term “paddock to plate” Australians appear to be more enthusiastic than ever to take their kids to properties where they can pull their veggies out of the dirt. </p><br>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>My project centres around some existing technology in the form of a probe developed by Dr Richard Stirzaker called “FullStop wetting front detector”. This device alone presents reading of water content in the soil at various depths increasing the accuracy of watering plants. My project idea intends to collect data from the probes on a mass scale like an orchard or a crop of grain using an automated drone. Being able to autonomously collect usable data cut labour costs create more time for other aspect of agriculture.<br> 

Being able to water your crops accurately and efficiently has many benefits, from lower water cost to less water run off means less wastage, healthier plants equals more resistance to insects and disease meaning less need for insecticides and herbicides. Above all and most important higher yield.  knowing when and how much to water can be difficult.<br> 

Flexibility is probably the main feature of my project, utilising the raspberry pi in particular its 40 pin gpio connector will greatly increase the ability to add to existing capabilities to record additional information from various other sensors which we may add in the future. I must note that creating my project idea I didn't really know how I was going to collect data from the sensors and probes and only knowing the raspberry pi as being a form factor computer, this assignment has enlightened me to the power of these small cheap and versatile devices.
Im going to be very honest here it was only late in my assignment creation that I started looking into what a raspberry pi is and its capabilities. its now clear that the focus of writing the main body of my project idea should have centred around raspberry technology. Since reading about this device it has open myself up to a new world of computing where im very excited to learn and use so much so I will be buying a raspberry pi today. As it stands now my project idea is still feasible. The raspberry pi has just cleared a lot of grey areas of my project and given me focus on what was the most important aspect of my idea that being flexibility to add to existing technology.</p>
<h2>Tools and technologies</h2>
<p>Aside from the FullStop wetting front detector, there needs to be a form of data logger set up to collect readings from the probe, as the probe only displays current data when prompted. From there we then need to have the ability to transmit the data to the drone or some sort of mobile vehicle. Finally there needs to be a program to read the data collected and present it in a matter to be useful. A Raspberry pi has wifi capabilities as well as bluetooth which would be perfect for sending and receiving logged data between the probe station and the drone.</p>
<h2>Skill set requirement</h2>
<p>Basic electronics skills would be need for making to io board which would connect to the Raspberry pi. The Raspberry pi has a 40 pin general purpose input output slot which its uses are unlimited. Obviously programming skills are needed to set the Raspberry Pi up to receive and send collected data as well as creating a user interface to display the data in a meaningful way. Pilot skills!!? no there are many drone out theses day that are fully automated. agriculture knowledge to be able to make data collected meaningful.</p>
<h2>Outcome</h2>
<p>The main successful out come would be to create usable data for the user. Second would be flexibility to add to existing technology giving the project longevity, being able to take different types of measurements like PH mineral or content from the soil will give more information to the user. I am hoping that my project if successful would help farms of large scale properties be able to at this state use water more effectively, even as basic as to introduce a different type of automation to agriculture would be a bonus. The over all aim is to potentially increase yield from crops.</p>
